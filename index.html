              It was during my first year at university that my career in IT took shape. I started studying different frontend and backend languages such as Python, SQL, JS and HTML/CSS. In my spare time, I got interested in different things like Blender, TailwindCSS and Figma, to name but a few. What's more, I've been able to add to my list of certifications by taking the TOEFL.

              When I started using Blender in 2021, I was somewhat taken aback: lots of menus, a cryptic interface with relatively poor ergonomics for beginners and little indication of where to start. However, I didn't give up and since then I've continued to improve my 3D modelling skills. Furthermore, having bought a 3D printer, it was inevitable that I wouldn't know how to use that software.

Two of my proudest works are the VLD website design (currently in production) and the original SCO² design.

              During my first two years at university, I started using two tools from the Adobe suite: Photoshop and Illustrator. While I don't particularly like Photoshop and I don't do much photo editing, Illustrator has been much more useful to me (even if it's still a bit complicated to get to grips with) in terms of both logo design and vector drawing.

              I don't need to explain that programming isn't always fun when you're first learning, but it does become so over time. As I said before and thanks to university, I know how to code in Python, HTML/CSS, JavaScript and C. However, that doesn't mean that's all I can do, not at all. Alongside my studies, I was able to gain Microsoft certification in C# as well as developing my knowledge of Tailwind CSS.
