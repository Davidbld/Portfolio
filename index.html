            When I started using Blender in 2021, I was somewhat taken aback: lots of menus, a cryptic interface with
            relatively poor ergonomics for beginners and little indication of where to start. However, I didn't give up
            and since then I've continued to improve my 3D modelling skills. Furthermore, having bought a 3D printer, it
            was inevitable that I would know how to use that software.

            Pong, a game released in 1972 by Atari that more or less changed video games forever. <br><br> When I
            started learning to code, it was primarily to make video games (like Frostpunk, Stray or Hollow Knight).
            However, in 2024, I had still never coded a game of any kind. So what better way to start practising than by
            reinventing a classic video game in my spare time? The code is opensource, and there are tutorials for doing
            just about everything in the game (so if I get stuck, I can always help myself a little). So I decided to
            make this game on Godot and publish my progress on GitHub as I went along. <br><br> It's important to note
            that I took a few liberties during development and that in the end the game is closer to the "Pelote Basque"
            game.

              As the saying goes, "Practice Makes Perfect". So the best way to make progress with Blender is to use it
              regularly, particularly through concrete projects that have a clear end goal, even if it's only a partial
              one. <br><br> Working on projects with a final vision allows you to confront a variety of challenges and
              hone your skills. For this illustration, I was inspired by a church hall, but I chose to replace the cross
              with a mathematically perfect geometric shape. This artistic choice adds a modern, abstract touch to the
              work, creating an interesting contrast between the classical architecture and the contemporary elements.

              Of course, I didn't make just one illustration, but for reasons of protecting my work, I won't be
              publishing anything more. Please don't hesitate to contact me if you have any questions or would like to
              find out more.

            <p>
              I decided to make this portfolio many months before I started working on this particular model. My
              portfolio went through three distinct models:
            </p>
            <br>
            <ul>
              <li>
                - A first version done on the spur of the moment and without any prior design.
              </li>
              <br>
              <li>
                - A second version that was more stylised and researched, but perhaps a little too much so.
              </li>
              <br>
              <li>
                - A third version (the current one) where I managed to balance inventiveness, novelty, minimalism and
                functionality.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <p>
              And as if the challenge wasn't enough, I decided to code it in a language that was still unknown to me
              when I started working on it.
