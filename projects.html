                        VLD Group is a company that we founded with friends during our first year at university,
                        with the aim of
                        bringing together several complementary services under one banner, such as VLD School and
                        VLD Workshop.
                        <br> VLD School is a specialist IT training platform offering a wide range of courses suited
                        to
                        different needs, whether it's learning a programming language, mastering specific software
                        or developing
                        design skills. <br> Our ambition is to provide quality resources to support learners in
                        their
                        professional and personal development.

                <p>
                    Pong, a game released in 1972 by Atari that more or less changed video games forever. <br>
                    When I
                    started learning to code, it was primarily to make video games (like Frostpunk, Stray or
                    Hollow Knight).
                    However, in 2024, I had still never coded a game of any kind. So what better way to start
                    practising than
                    by
                    reinventing a classic video game in my spare time? The code is opensource, and there are
                    tutorials for
                    doing
                    just about everything in the game (so if I get stuck, I can always help myself a little). So
                    I decided to
                    make this game on Godot and publish my progress on GitHub as I went along. <br> It's
                    important to note
                    that I took a few liberties during development and that in the end the game is closer to the
                    "Pelote
                    Basque"
                    game.

                        This is a portfolio design I'd made for a friend, which unfortunately was never coded due to
                        lack of time.
                        <br> My approach was minimalist, using a black and white colour palette to create a clean,
                        modern look. I
                        aimed to introduce a touch of originality by adding small dots on the sides, providing a
                        distinctive and
                        elegant visual effect. <br> This choice aimed to combine sobriety and innovation, creating a
                        clear and
                        aesthetic interface while subtly drawing attention to the essential elements of the content.

                    Social CO² (<span class="italic">or SCO2</span>) is a social network that we developed with
                    four friends
                    as part of a university project focusing on ecology. <br><br> On this project, I was
                    responsible for
                    leading the team and conceiving the entire design of the site, while the other members
                    concentrated on
                    developing and finding relevant data. <br><br> Thanks to our collective efforts and
                    effective
                    collaboration, we outperformed the other groups and achieved top marks. However, some
                    members of the team
                    would have liked more time to refine the final result.

                <p>
                    As the saying goes, "Practice Makes Perfect". So the best way to make progress with Blender
                    is to use it
                    regularly, particularly through concrete projects that have a clear end goal, even if it's
                    only a partial
                    one. <br> Working on projects with a final vision allows you to confront a variety of
                    challenges and hone
                    your skills. For this illustration, I was inspired by a church hall, but I chose to replace
                    the cross with
                    a mathematically perfect geometric shape. This artistic choice adds a modern, abstract touch
                    to the work,
                    creating an interesting contrast between the classical architecture and the contemporary
                    elements.

                        Of course, I didn't make just one illustration, but for reasons of protecting my work, I
                        won't be
                        publishing anything more. Please don't hesitate to contact me if you have any questions

            </p>
            <div class="text-center tracking-widest">
                <p>
                    I decided to make this portfolio many months before I started working on this particular
                    model. My
                    portfolio went through three distinct models:
                </p>
                <br>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        - A first version done on the spur of the moment and without any prior design.
                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <li>
                        - A second version that was more stylised and researched, but perhaps a little too much
                        so.
                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <li>
                        - A third version (the current one) where I managed to balance inventiveness, novelty,
                        minimalism and
                        functionality.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                <p>
                    And as if the challenge wasn't enough, I decided to code it in a language that was still
                    unknown to me
                    when I started working on it.
