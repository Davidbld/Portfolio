                VLD Group is a company that we founded with friends during our first year at university, with the aim of
                bringing together several complementary services under one banner, such as VLD School and VLD Workshop.
                <br> VLD School is a specialist IT training platform offering a wide range of courses suited to different
                needs, whether it's learning a programming language, mastering specific software or developing design
                skills. <br> Our ambition is to provide quality resources to support learners in their professional and
                personal development.

              When I started learning to code, it was primarily to make video games (like Frostpunk, Stray or Hollow Knight). However,
              in 2024, I had still never coded a game of any kind. So what better way to start practising than by
              reinventing a classic video game in my spare time? The code is opensource, and there are tutorials for
              doing just about everything in the game (so if I get stuck, I can always help myself a little). So I
              decided to make this game on Godot and publish my progress on GitHub as I went along. <br> It's important
              to note that I took a few liberties during development and that in the end the game is closer to the
              "Pelote Basque" game.

              This is a portfolio design I'd made for a friend, which unfortunately was never coded due to lack of time.
              <br> My approach was minimalist, using a black and white colour palette to create a clean, modern look. I
              aimed to introduce a touch of originality by adding small dots on the sides, providing a distinctive and
              elegant visual effect. <br> This choice aimed to combine sobriety and innovation, creating a clear and
              aesthetic interface while subtly drawing attention to the essential elements of the content.

              more time to refine the final result.

              Blender's Illustrations
            </h4>
            <p class="block font-sans text-base antialiased font-normal leading-relaxed text-gray-700 tracking-widest">
              As the saying goes, "Practice Makes Perfect". So the best way to make progress with Blender is to use it
              regularly, particularly through concrete projects that have a clear end goal, even if it's only a partial
              one. <br> Working on projects with an end-to-end vision allows you to take on a variety of challenges and
              sharpen your skills. For this illustration, I was inspired by a church hall, but I chose to replace the
              cross with a mathematically perfect geometric shape. This artistic choice adds a modern, abstract touch to
              the work, creating an interesting contrast between the classical architecture and the contemporary
              elements.

              Of course, I didn't make just one illustration, but for reasons of protecting my work, I won't be
              publishing anything more. Please don't hesitate to contact me if you have any questions or would like to
              find out more.

                I decided to make this portfolio many months before I started working on this particular model. My
                portfolio went through three distinct models:
              </p>
              <ul class="tracking-widest">
                <li>- A first version done on the spur of the moment and without any prior design.</li>
                <li>- A second version that was more stylised and researched, but perhaps a little too much so.</li>
                <li>- A third version (the current one) where I managed to balance inventiveness, novelty, minimalism
                  and functionality.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                And as if the challenge wasn't enough, I decided to code it in a language that was still unknown to me
                when I started working on it.
