            It was during my first year at university that my career in IT took shape. I started studying different
            frontend and backend languages such as Python, SQL, JS and HTML/CSS. In my spare time, I got interested in
            different things like Blender, TailwindCSS and Figma, to name but a few. What's more, I've been able to add
            to my list of certifications by taking the CLES.

            When I started using Blender in 2021, I was somewhat taken aback: lots of menus, a cryptic interface with
            relatively poor ergonomics for beginners and little indication of where to start. However, I didn't give up
            and since then I've continued to improve my 3D modelling skills. Furthermore, having bought a 3D printer, it
            was inevitable that I would know how to use that software.

            I was introduced to Figma during a group project at university. Right from the start I knew I was going to
            love it. I've loved design from an early age and I've always had a passion for creating objects. Two of my
            proudest works are the VLD website design and the original SCOÂ² design.

            During my first two years at university, I started using two tools from the Adobe suite: Photoshop and
            Illustrator. While I don't particularly like Photoshop and I don't do much photo editing, Illustrator has
            been much more useful to me (even if it's still a bit complicated to get to grips with) in terms of both
            logo design and vector drawing.

            I don't need to explain that programming isn't always fun when you're first learning, but it does become so
            over time. As I said before and thanks to university, I know how to code in Python, HTML/CSS, JavaScript and
            C. However, that doesn't mean that's all I can do, not at all. Alongside my studies, was able to gain
            Microsoft certification in C# as well as developing my knowledge of Tailwind CSS.

            The most important thing when working in a group is to be surrounded by the right people. I've been lucky
            enough to work with Valentin Mary and Luka Baudrant, two friends of mine, on two or three projects. They
            taught me a lot about programming and Git in general.
