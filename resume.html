            It was during my first year at university that my career in IT took shape. I started studying different
            frontend and backend languages such as Python, SQL, JS and HTML/CSS. In my spare time, I got interested in
            different things like Blender, TailwindCSS and Figma, to name but a few. What's more, I've been able to add
            to my list of certifications by taking the CLES.

            When I started using Blender in 2021, I was somewhat taken aback: lots of menus, a cryptic interface with
            relatively poor ergonomics for beginners and little indication of where to start. However, I didn't give up
            and since then I've continued to improve my 3D modelling skills. Furthermore, having bought a 3D printer, it
            was inevitable that I would know how to use that software.

            proudest works are the VLD website design and the original SCOÂ² design.

            During my first two years at university, I started using two tools from the Adobe suite: Photoshop and
            Illustrator. While I don't particularly like Photoshop and I don't do much photo editing, Illustrator has
            been much more useful to me (even if it's still a bit complicated to get to grips with) in terms of both
            logo design and vector drawing.

            I don't need to explain that programming isn't always fun when you're first learning, but it does become so
            over time. As I said before and thanks to university, I know how to code in Python, HTML/CSS, JavaScript and
            C. However, that doesn't mean that's all I can do, not at all. Alongside my studies, was able to gain
            Microsoft certification in C# as well as developing my knowledge of Tailwind CSS.

            enough to work with Valentin Mary and Luka Baudrant, two friends of mine, on two or three projects. They
            taught me a lot about programming and Git in general.
